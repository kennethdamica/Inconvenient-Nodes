Inconvenient-Nodes
==================

An application of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the least convenient nodes of a directed graph (w/ PyGame)

The idea behind this method is to optimize procedurally-generated game design by placing rewards in the areas of the map
that are furthest from the least-cost paths through the level. Game designers routinely do this manually, but this method
allows it to be done automatically.
